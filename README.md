# Text-to-XML Conversion Script

This repository contains a script for converting text file into XML level file that can be loaded into Science Birds

## Installation

To use this script, you must have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_new">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_new">npm</a> installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

1. Run the script using the command `npm start -s="<SOURCE_FOLDER>"`. For example, `npm start -s "./competition"`.
2. The script will output the XML file in the `<SOURCE_FOLDER>/<TEAM_NAME>/levels/<TARGET_CHARACTER>` folder, which has the same structure as the source folder. The file `xml_log_<DATE_TIME>.txt` will be created in the `<SOURCE_FOLDER>/logs` folder.

Please ensure that the source folder is in the same folder as the script and has the following structure:

```
